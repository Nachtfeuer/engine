Angle between lines The calculation of the angle is related to the direction vectors of both lines which you find in vector documention. Intersection point of two lines First to say it's more likely in 3d space that two lines do not intersect while in 2d the only case where to lines do not intersect is when they are parallel. However the calculation is not too hard considering following approach: First we have two lines as shown in line representation but with two different factors which should provide us the same point when there is an intersection so we can say: p1 + a \\cdot \\vec{v1} = p2 + b \\cdot \\vec{v2} p1 + a \\cdot \\vec{v1} = p2 + b \\cdot \\vec{v2} First we do is we subtract p1 on both sides. a \\cdot \\vec{v1} = p2 - p1 + b \\cdot \\vec{v2} a \\cdot \\vec{v1} = p2 - p1 + b \\cdot \\vec{v2} Now we apply cross product \\vec{v2} \\vec{v2} on both sides. a \\cdot \\vec{v1} \\times \\vec{v2} = (p2 - p1) \\times \\vec{v2} a \\cdot \\vec{v1} \\times \\vec{v2} = (p2 - p1) \\times \\vec{v2} The b \\cdot \\vec{v2} b \\cdot \\vec{v2} did go away because the cross product with same vector is the null vector. From programming perspective you now have to consider that two lines can refer - as special cases - to a plane where one dimension might go away. As a result you have three ways how to calculate the factor a a : First: we define \\vec{v3} = \\vec{v1} \\times \\vec{v2} \\vec{v3} = \\vec{v1} \\times \\vec{v2} and \\vec{v4} = (p2 - p1) \\times \\vec{v2} \\vec{v4} = (p2 - p1) \\times \\vec{v2} Solution 1: a = v4_x / v3_x a = v4_x / v3_x (when v3_x v3_x is not 0) Solution 2: a = v4_y / v3_y a = v4_y / v3_y (when v3_y v3_y is not 0) Solution 3: a = v4_z / v3_z a = v4_z / v3_z (when v3_z v3_z is not 0) If no solution does match then there is no intersection point otherwise you now can use first line p1 + a \\cdot \\vec{v1} p1 + a \\cdot \\vec{v1} to calculate the intersection point.

Subtraction It's a subtraction per coordinate: \\vec{a} - \\vec{b} = \\left(\\array{a_x - b_x \\\\ a_y - b_y \\\\ a_z - b_y}\\right) \\vec{a} - \\vec{b} = \\left(\\array{a_x - b_x \\\\ a_y - b_y \\\\ a_z - b_y}\\right) The implementation is done by overwriting the __sub__ operator which allows you to write in code a - b a - b same way as in the formular.

There following special properties: When \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 0 \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 0 then the angle between those two vectors is 90^\\circ 90^\\circ When the value is negative (> 90^\\circ 90^\\circ ) the direction of the one is opposite to the other. That is useful if you consider rendering of an object; the camera does see the object frontside but one or more triangles of the backside are not visible.
